## Hi there 👋

# 🏷 About Me

I am currently pursuing a master's degree at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Hainan University, supervised by Prof. [Teng Zhou](https://scs.hainanu.edu.cn/info/1052/3112.htm) [![Citations](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fyuchaozhi%2Fyuchaozhi.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oQIF23YAAAAJ). GPA: 3.96/4.00, ranked 1st among all students in the major. I received my bachelor's degree from the College of Flexible Electronics, Shaanxi University of Science and Technology. Our team includes PhD students and postdoctoral researchers such as Prof. [Youyi Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gSzHVNkAAAAJ), Dr. [Zhizhe Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j2aV91UAAAAJ), Postdoc. [Farooq Ahmed](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bTVezlQAAAAJ), and Postdoc. [Shahid Ali](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B3jovoIAAAAJ), who are actively contributing to their respective research areas.

My research interest includes Spatiotemporal Data Mining, Time Series Analysis, Machine Learning, Intelligent Transportation System and Traffic Flow Forecasting.
